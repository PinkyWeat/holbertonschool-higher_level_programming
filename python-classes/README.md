# Python - Classes

### Object Oriented Programming

[Importance](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/object-oriented-programming):

Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches. One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating ``objects``. This is known as ``Object-Oriented Programming`` (OOP). An ``object`` has two characteristics:

    --> attributes
    --> behavior

Let's take an example:

A ``parrot`` is an object, as it has the following properties:

    name, age, color as ``attributes``
    singing, dancing as ``behavior``

The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as ``DRY`` (Don't Repeat Yourself).

In Python, the concept of ``OOP`` follows some basic principles:

### A ``class`` is a blueprint for the object.

We can think of class as a sketch of a parrot with labels. It contains all the details about the name, colors, size etc. Based on these descriptions, we can study about the parrot. Here, a parrot is an object.

The example for class of ``Parrot`` can be :

    class Parrot:
        pass

Here, we use the ``class`` keyword to define an empty class ``Parrot``. From class, we construct instances. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class.

### Object

An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined. Therefore, **no memory or storage is allocated** .

The example for object of parrot class can be:

    obj = Parrot()

Here, ``obj`` is an object of class ``Parrot`` .
