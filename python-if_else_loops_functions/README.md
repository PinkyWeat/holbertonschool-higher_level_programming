# Python - if/else, loops, functions
---

## Description

### if/else

[Python supports](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp) the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

		Equals: a == b
		Not Equals: a != b
		Less than: a < b
		Less than or equal to: a <= b
		Greater than: a > b
		Greater than or equal to: a >= b

When talking about ``if/else`` conditions we are comparing values. There can be 0 or more ``elif`` conditions as well.  The elif keyword is pythons way of saying **"if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition"**.

Last we have the ``else`` part. The else keyword catches **anything which isn't caught** by the preceding conditions.

### Loops

``for`` - A for [loop](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp) is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

``break`` - With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items.

``continue`` - With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next.

``range()`` - To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, also the function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

``pass`` - a for loop can not be left empty, in which case you put the pass keyword.

### Functions

A [function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp) is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.
